# Food Ordering UI

This is a food-app which displays us the list of food available in the resturant.Before moving to the actual functionality at a glanc we loof after the UI design only. So that's why I have made this Catalog page of any Resturant which is showing us the results based upon the available food in the Resturant. By clicking the **Order Now** button we can order the food listed over there.

## Points to remember while testing the UI

 - First be remember, this is not a full functional app.
 - It is under development right now. Just uploaded the UI codebase only.
 - You can give suggestions and review based upon the Front-end. Suggestions are always welcomed!


## Deployment

To deploy this project run

-   **1.Step - clone(download) this project to your local directory**
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SoumyadeepOSD/React-Native-Food-List-App.git
```

-   **2.Step - open App.js**

-   **install dependencies to project by terminal**

```bash
    yarn add nodemon
```
nodemon is basically used to perform "hot-reload" without stopping down the server.

```bash
    yarn install
```
-   **To run the app in development server**

```bash
    yarn start
```
*You may have to run "expo start" to activate the server*
```bash
    expo start
```
* This will start a development server

- After starting the development server you can see one barcode and a link, follow one of them to load the *Application*
- Any changes made in the codebase will reflect live in server.

*This project has not been completed yet. Feel free to give suggestions on it for improvement. I will make too many changes when complete this project successfully*
